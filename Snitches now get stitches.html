                                <p><em>Pete, our commune plague doctor standing in front of his medic shack</em></p>
                                </span>
                                
                                <p>The paranormal commune is built on many things. I do not mean literally of course.<br>&nbsp;We all know the commune is built atop disused mine shafts which make us all susceptible to sink holes in our sleep. No, the commune is of course built on trust </p>
                                
                                <p>This mentality is clearly what our glorious leaders, Rory Powers and Kit Grier, were thinking when they decreed a new commune policy in the late hours last night to go into effect immediately. Powers announced new legislation simply stating <em>&lsquo;Snitches get stiches&rsquo;</em>. When asked to clarify he replied with &lsquo;get out&rsquo;.</p>
                                
                                <p>Callum Spencer and Eve Stevenson, the commune&rsquo;s legal experts, who were recently chosen on the basis they had watched more episodes of Judge Judy than anyone else set out to apply the new law.</p>
                                   
                                <p>After a lengthy 23-minute debate process they turned the law into formal writing.<br><br>The legislation extends the health coverage for whistle blowers and those who leak information which is critical to the commune or the individuals in it. Previously if you cut yourself, the medical guidelines from Pete our commune plague doctor stated, <em>&lsquo;sucker up and put leeches on it&rsquo;</em>.<br><br>&nbsp;While most of the plebs have been told to continue with this approach, members who have released sensitive information to the public will get their commune medical insurance extended to cover all cuts to the flesh. Whistle-blowers can now go visit Pete in the commune&rsquo;s modern medical shack where using his wife&rsquo;s sewing kit, he will stich up the wound to prevent the blood from pouring out.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Critics of the legislation claim that less blood for the leeches will lead to <em>&lsquo;a return of night-time attacks by the leech demon&rsquo;</em> however commune higher ups have dismissed these claims.</p>
                                    
                                <p>The Commune issued a press statement following the criticism</p>
                                   
                                <p>&lsquo;<em>The idea that we will bring back the leech demon is pure untruth; we only need to increase human sacrifices by 1 a month to offset the loss of blood by the snitches get stitches policy. We have also made a note of the critics and they will be <b>dealt with.</b></em></p>
                                
                                <p>While Pete the Commune Plague Doctor has only ever dealt with herbal mixtures to cure someone, experts believe he will have a fair good crack at stitching up a cut.</p>
